# BikeRental-FDV solutions technical interview.

This is a technical interview proposal of the company Inventive-FDV. I think the exercise is a good piece of entretainment for the mind.

Next comes the mains exercise statement of work:

# Context
A company rents bikes under following options:

1. Rental by hour, charging $5 per hour
2. Rental by day, charging $20 a day
3. Rental by week, changing $60 a week
4. Family Rental, is a promotion that can include from 3 to 5 Rentals (of any type) with a discount of 30% of the total price

# Assigment:
1. Implement a set of classes to model this domain and logic
2. Add automated tests to ensure a coverage over 85%
3. Use GitHub to store and version your code
4. Apply all the recommended practices you would use in a real project
5. Add a README.md file to the root of your repository to explain: your design, the development practices you applied and how run the tests.

Note: we don't expect any kind of application, just a set of classes with its automated tests.

# Deliverables:
The link to your repository 

#The proposed solution

1st. I will make a UML model, just to understand the problem.
2nd. I will generate the basic class structure (...with the very same modeler, in this case I used "genmymodel.com").
3rd. I will drive the development using the test cases, is slower, but still a lot of fun to code!
4th. Iterate the 3rd step, until all the tests cases pass.
